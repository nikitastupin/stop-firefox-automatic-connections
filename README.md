# stop-firefox-automatic-connections

To stop Firefox from making automatic connections just place `user.js` from this repository to your profile directory. To find out where profile directory located on your system please refer to [How do I find my profile?](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profiles-where-firefox-stores-user-data#w_how-do-i-find-my-profile) article.

This is particularly useful for keeping Burp Suite proxy tab as clean as possible.

Please note that Firefox changes over time so we might need to make changes to `user.js` in the future. Issues and pull requests are welcome!
